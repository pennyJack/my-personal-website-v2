##Hi, I'm André.

I’ve been working in the digital marketing space since January 2018, first as a SEA specialist, then transitioned to an Activation Manager position in Programmatic Advertising. I was responsible for planning and managing Programmatic campaigns for well-known brands in the health care sector.

Since I’ve always been more interested in the business’s technology side, I’ve started working as Product Implementation Manager in the Digital Technology department of [Dentsu Germany](https://www.dentsu.com/) in April 2019.

In a nutshell, the department oversees and maintains the infrastructure that powers the digital advertising ecosystem. Most of their efforts are focused on Programmatic Advertising but not exclusively.

In March 2021, I joined the **Data Intelligence & Technologies** unit of [Douglas](https://corporate.douglas.de/) as **Marketing Technology Engineer**.

Douglas is Europe’s leading e-commerce platform for premium beauty products and [one of Germany’s top-selling online retailers](https://www.ehi.org/de/top-100-umsatzstaerkste-onlineshops-in-deutschland/).

Our team handles consent management, tag management (client- and server-side), and data quality assurance. Besides, we serve as technical advisors to our stakeholders and are responsible for adopting and implementing new marketing systems that extend our seasoned technology stack.

Feel free to get in touch or send me an invitation to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9-wibbeke-aa76a4138/).

##What’s your blog about?

I’m passionate about marketing and advertising technologies, how they work, and setting them up. As such, you see many posts explaining these technologies’ inner workings and how to implement them properly. I’m also giving my best to provide you with a better understanding to assess their capabilities and limitations adequately.

Finally, there are many (technical) challenges ahead of the industry, particularly the rising awareness of data privacy, whether enforced by law or browser vendors.

I think it’s an essential and necessary step in the evolution of digital marketing. However, it doesn’t always go hand in hand with the expectations of clients. Thus, it’s vital to find solutions that help marketers reach their goals and respect their customers’ data privacy rights.

##What else is there to know about you?

It’s essential to learn about the web and get acquainted with its primary technologies, namely HTML, CCS, and JavaScript, in case you want to know how marketing and advertising systems work.

To get a better understanding, I decided to spend some of my spare time working on my web development skills. For instance, I build this website using modern front-end technologies, like [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [GatesbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I’m also hosting a [monthly Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/hack-and-talk-meetup-duesseldorf/) in Düsseldorf for people who are interested in learning about web development with JavaScript.
